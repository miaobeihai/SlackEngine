This is a log of my development of dr_opus - a single file public domain Opus decoder in C. The purpose of this log is
to track the development of the project and log how I solved various problems.

References:
    RFC 6716 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6716 - Definition of the Opus Audio Codec
    RFC 7845 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7845 - Ogg Encapsulation for the Opus Audio Codec
    
    
The main reference for development is RFC 6716. An important detail with this specification is in Section 1

   The primary normative part of this specification is provided by the
   source code in Appendix A.  Only the decoder portion of this software
   is normative, though a significant amount of code is shared by both
   the encoder and decoder.  Section 6 provides a decoder conformance
   test.  The decoder contains a great deal of integer and fixed-point
   arithmetic that needs to be performed exactly, including all rounding
   considerations, so any useful specification requires domain-specific
   symbolic language to adequately define these operations.
   Additionally, any conflict between the symbolic representation and
   the included reference implementation must be resolved.  For the
   practical reasons of compatibility and testability, it would be
   advantageous to give the reference implementation priority in any
   disagreement.  The C language is also one of the most widely
   understood, human-readable symbolic representations for machine
   behavior.  For these reasons, this RFC uses the reference
   implementation as the sole symbolic representation of the codec.

What this is basically saying is that the source code should be considered the main point of reference for the format of
the Opus bit stream. We cannot, however, just willy nilly take code from the reference implementation because that would
cause licensing problems. However, I'm going to make a prediction before I even begin: I think RFC 6716 with a bit
intuition, problem solving and help from others it can be figured out. Indeed, I think RFC 6716 may even be enough, and
that perhaps the authors of said specification refer to the source code as a self-defence mechanism to guard themselves
from possible subtle errors in the specification. If I'm wrong, the log below will track it.

Lets begin...

==================
- Inserted skeleton code with licensing information. Dual licensed as Public Domain _or_ MIT, whichever you prefer. API
  is undecided as of yet.
- Decided on supporting C89. Not yet decided on how the standard library will be used.
- Deciding for now to use the init() style of API from dr_wav and dr_mp3 which takes a pre-allocated decoder object. May
  need to change this to dr_flac style open() (or perhaps new()/delete()) if the size of the structure is too big.
- dr_wav, etc. use booleans for results status so I'm copying that for consistency.
- Added boilerplate for standard sized types (copied from mini_al).
- Added a comment at the top of the file to show that this isn't complete (even though it's in the "wip" folder!).
- Added boilerplate for read and seek callbacks (copied from dr_flac).
- Added shell APIs:
  - dropus_init()
    - Not requiring onSeek for the moment because I'm hoping that we can make that optional somehow, with restriction.
  - dropus_uninit()
    - Does nothing at the moment, but in future will need to close a file when the decoder is opened against a file.
- Added some common overrideable macros (taken from dr_flac):
  - DROPUS_ASSERT
  - DROPUS_COPY_MEMORY
  - DROPUS_ZERO_MEMORY
  - DROPUS_ZERO_OBJECT
- Decided to use the C standard library for now. This simplifies things like memset() and assert(). Currently using the
  following headers:
  - stddef.h
  - stdint.h
  - stdlib.h
  - string.h
  - assert.h
- Added some infrastructure for future APIs: dropus_init_file() and dropus_init_memory()
  - In dr_flac, dr_wav and dr_mp3, a mistake was made with how the internal file handle is managed by the decoder. In
    these libraries the pUserData member of the decoder structure is recycled to hold the FILE pointer. dr_opus is
    changing this to be it's own member of the main decoder structure.
  - The internal members for use with dropus_init_memory() use the same system as dr_mp3. See drmp3.memory.
- Added dropus_init_file()
  - All init() APIs call dropus_init_internal() which is where the main initialization work is done.
  - This is using the stdio FILE API.
  - dropus_uninit() has been updated to close the file.
  - Added dropus_fopen() for compiler compatibility. Taken from dr_flac, but added the "mode" parameter for consistency
    with fopen().
  - Added dropus_fclose() for namespace consistency with dropus_fopen().
- Added dropus_init_memory()
  - onRead and onSeek callbacks taken from dr_mp3.
- INITIAL COMMIT

===================
- Downloading all official test vectors in preparation for future testing.

2018/12/01 03:58 PM
===================
- Decided to figure out the different encapsulations for Opus so I can figure out a design for data flow.
  - Ogg: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7845
  - Matroska: https://wiki.xiph.org/MatroskaOpus
  - WebM: https://www.webmproject.org/docs/container/
  - MPEG-TS: https://wiki.xiph.org/OpusTS
  - Mysterious encapsulation used by the official test vectors. Looking at this it's hard to tell what they are using for
    this, but I'm assuming it's not documented. Will need to figure that one out for myself later.
- Since WebM is a subset of Matroska, can we combine those together to avoid code duplication?
- Upon reading into Ogg and MPEG-TS encapsulation (not looked into Matroska in detail yet) it looks like handling large
  channel counts is going to be a pain. It can support up to 255 channels, which are made up of multiple streams. My
  instict is telling me that we won't be able to use a fixed sized data structure and instead might require dynamic
  allocations. Darn...
- Leaning towards a two-tier architecture - a low-level decoder for raw Opus streams, and a high-level API for encapsulated
  streams. Opus packets support only 1 or 2 channels which means the size of the structure _can_ be fixed.
  - Currently I'm thinking something like the following:
    - struct dropus_stream - low-level Opus stream decoding
    - struct dropus        - high-level encapsulated Opus stream decoding
      - struct dropus_ogg (Ogg Opus)
      - struct dropus_mk (Matroska)
      - struct dropus_ts (MPEG-TS)
      - struct dropus_tv (That annoying non-standard and undocumented encapsulation used by the test vectors)
- The maximum number of samples per frame (per-channel) is 960 because:
  - The maximum frame size for wideband (16kHz) is 60: 16*60 = 960
  - The maximum frame size for fullband (48kHz) is 20: 48*20 = 960
  - To account for stereo frames we would need to multiply 960 by 2: 960*2 = 1920
  - This is small enough that it can be stored statically inside the dropus_stream structure.
- It looks like low level Opus streams won't be able to do efficient seeking without an encapsulation.
- An Opus stream is made up of packets. Each packet has 1 or more frames. Each frame can be made up of 1 or 2 channels.
- The size of the packet in bytes is unknown at the Opus stream level - it depends on the encapsulation to know the
  size of the packet. This could be a bit of a problem because we may need to know the size of a frame in order to know
  how much data we need from the client. I'm wondering if the low-level API should look something like the following:
  - dropus_result dropus_stream_decode_packet(dropus_stream* pOpusStream, const void* pCompressedData, size_t compressedDataSize);
    - This will require the caller to have information on the size of the packet.
- Added struct dropus_stream_packet, dropus_stream_frame.
- Each packet contains a byte that defines the structure of the packet. It's called the TOC byte
  (Section 3.1.  The TOC Byte) in the RFC 6716.
- Added skeleton implementations for dropus_stream_init() and dropus_stream_decode_packet().
- Added helpers for decoding the different parts of TOC byte.
  - dropus_toc_config(), dropus_toc_s() and dropus_toc_c()
- Added enum for the three different modes as outlined in Section 3.1 of RFC 6716. Also added an API to extract this
  mode from the config component of the TOC: dropus_toc_config_mode() and dropus_toc_mode().
- Added API to extract sample rate from the TOC: dropus_toc_config_sample_rate() and dropus_toc_sample_rate()
- Added API to extract the size of an Opus frame in PCM frames from the TOC: 
  - dropus_toc_config_frame_size_in_pcm_frames() and dropus_toc_frame_size_in_pcm_frames().
- COMMIT

2018/12/02 09:45 AM
===================
- Compiling for the first time. Targetting C89 so need to get it all working property right from the start.
- "test" folder added to my local repository. Not version controlled yet as I'm not sure I want to include all of
  the test stuff in the repository. Will definitely not be version controlling the test vectors. Perhaps use a submodule?
- Have decided to not support the mysterious encapsulation format used by the test vectors in dr_opus itself. Instead
  I'm just doing it manually in the test program.
- After attempting to build the C++ version, it appears Clang will attempt to #include stdint.h from Visual Studio's
  standard library which fails. May need to come up with a way to avoid the dependency on stdint.h. Same thing also
  happens with stdlib.h.
- Have cleaned up the sized types stuff for Clang to avoid the dependency on stdint, however errors are still happening
  due to the use of stdlib.h. Leaving the Clang C++ issue for now. It's technically a Clang issue rather than dr_opus.
- COMMIT
- Have decided to version control test programs, but not test vectors. Instead I'm putting a note in a readme about
  where to download and place the test vectors.
- In my experience I have found that having a testing infrastructure set up earlier saves a lot of time in the long run
  so the next thing I have decided to work on is a test program. It makes sense to test against the official test vectors,
  so the first thing is to figure out this undocumented encapsulation format...
  
Test Vector Encapsulation Format
--------------------------------
- All test vectors seem to start with two bytes of 0x00.
  - This does not feel like a magic number or identifier.
- Noticed that first 4 bytes add up to a relatively small number. A counter of some kind in little endian format?
- A pattern can be seen in testvector02.bit:
  - The bytes 00 00 00 XX can been seen repeating. This indicates some kind of blocking.
  - From the first 4 bytes you see the hex value of 0x0000001E which equals 30 in decimal
  - Counting forward 30 bytes brings us 4 bytes before the next set of 00 00 00 XX bytes. Definitely starting to feel like
    the first 4 bytes are a byte counter.
  - Skipping past those four bytes and looking at the next 00 00 00 XX bytes we get 0x0000001D which is 29 in decimal.
  - Again, counting forward by that number of bytes brings us to 4 bytes prior to the next 00 00 00 XX block. First 4
    bytes are definitely a byte counter.
- It makes sense that each of these blocks are an Opus packet.
- Still don't know what the second set of 4 bytes could represent... Does it matter for our purposes? All we care about
  is the raw Opus bit stream.
  - A Google search for "opus test vector format" brings up the following result (a PDF document):
    - https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/82/slides/codec-4.pdf
    - From the "Force Multipliers" page:
      - "The range coder has 32 bits of state which must match between the encoder and decoder"
      - "Provides a checksum of all encoding and decoding decisions"
      - "opus_demo bitstreams include the range value with every packet and test for mismatches"
    - Willing to bet that the extra 4 bytes are that "32 bits of state". This is actually good for dr_opus.
- I think the format is just a list of Opus packets with 8 bytes of header data for each one:
    4 bytes: Opus packet size in bytes
    4 bytes: 32 bit of range coder state
    [Opus Packet]
--------------------------------

- The test program can either hard code a list of vector files or we can enumerate over files in known directories. I'm
  preferring the latter to make it easier to add new vectors. It's also consistent with the way dr_flac does it which has
  been pretty good in the past.
- Started work on a "common" lib for test programs. First thing is the new file iterator.
  - File iterator now done, but only supporting Windows currently.
- Have implemented the logic for loading test vectors and the byte counter (and I'm assuming the range state) is actually
  in big-endian, not little-endian. I'm an idiot!
- Copying endian management APIs from dr_flac over to dr_opus.
- Basic infrastructure for testing against the standard test vectors is now done.

==================
- The packet enumeration in the test program seems to work so far, but I'm still not 100% sure that my assumptions are
  correct. Adding more validation to dropus_stream_decode_packet() to increase my certainty. The next stage is to
  implement all of the main packet validation.
- Question for later. How are "Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) or lost packet" handled? Should
  dropus_stream_decode_packet() return an error in this case?
- Code for validating packet codes 0, 1 and 2 are now in, however untested so far. Code 3 is a bit more complicated and
  right now I need to eat dinner...
- COMMIT

2018/12/03 6:40 PM

- Code 3 CBR is done (no VBR yet). Still untested.
- Code 3 VBR is done. Still untested.
- Testing and debugging against the standard test vectors coming next.
- Fixed a few compiler warnings.
